                                    combined with Grafana for visualization.
                                    These tools enable me to identify and
                                    resolve potential issues in applications and
                                    infrastructure. By leveraging these
                                    monitoring stacks, I can create custom
                                    dashboards to visualize critical data,
                                    monitor performance metrics, and analyze
                                    logs.

                            Computer science and Electronic. My third-year
                            studies concentrated on embedded systems and IT,
                            while my second year explored automation and the
                            Internet of Things. My participation in
                            extracurricular activities at ENSEA contributed to
                            the development of my leadership and organizational
                            skills.

                        In addition to these hobbies, I am deeply committed to
                        working on personal development projects. By investing
                        my time and effort into these projects, I can explore
                        new ideas, learn new technologies, and refine my skills
                        in software development and engineering. These personal
                        endeavors enable me to continuously grow, both
                        personally and professionally, and stay at the forefront
                        of the ever-evolving tech industry. You can find a few
